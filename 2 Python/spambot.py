    spam = input("Enter your spam text:\n-> ") #Gets the input from the user and stores it as the spam text 
    num = input("\nNumber of times to spam (Leave it for if you want it to spam forever):\n-> ") #sets number of time to spam
    if num == "": #if num is blank sets num to 999999... you won't let this loop that many times would you ?
        num = 999999

    print('\nThe spam will begin in 10 seconds... BRACE YOURSELF !!!\n')#BRACE YOURSELF !!!!
    print("Return to this window and press 'ctrl/cmd + c' to stop the spam anytime\n\n")#how to stop the chaos
    sleep(10)#gives time for lazy users to point towards the input box

    for _ in range(int(num)):
